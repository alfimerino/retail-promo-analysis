**Transforming raw POS transaction logs into actionable promotional performance insights.**

Majin Retail Analytics is a data pipeline and analytics project that ingests messy point-of-sale (POS) data, applies business-specific cleaning rules, computes core financial & sales KPIs, and delivers an interactive dashboard for stakeholders to evaluate promotional campaign performance (starting with Spring 2025 / previous year results).

Currently in early development — focused on delivering the first end-to-end MVP: clean data → core metrics → stakeholder-facing dashboard.

## 🎯 Current Milestone (MJ - Spring 2025 Campaign Retrospective)

**Goal**: Transform raw POS logs into a cleaned, interactive dashboard to evaluate last year’s promo performance.
